# The intracacies of university data

I collected data on the top 2000 universities worldwide in three steps:

Web Scraping: Gathering info from CWUR rankings.
APIs: Enriching the data using Wikipedia APIs.
More Scraping: Extracting additional information from Wikipedia webpages.

After that, I utilize the data to provide insightful plots that give a broader perspective on the dataset. We start by visualizing the global distribution of universities by country, highlighting disparities in higher education worldwide. Then, we explore university types using text mining, revealing trends in the types of institutions that dominate the top 2000. Additionally, we examine the temporal dimension, shedding light on when these prestigious universities were established, offering insights into historical trends. Lastly, we analyze how student counts correlate with university rankings, uncovering interesting patterns.

I then present three more plots for in-depth exploration. We dive into student counts across different university types, compare university type percentages across ranking ranges, and visualize the concentration of private universities globally. These plots provide a deeper understanding of the dataset's intricacies.
